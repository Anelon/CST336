                <h3>Why Use?</h3>
                <p>The faster web language.</p>
                <p>
                    Why would you use it, its about 30% faster than Javascript. Why would you not use something that is faster.
                    If you need more convincing, WASM also allows you to compile from existing codebases
                    such as C or C++ this also gives you access to libraries that were written in that language.
