      <p>The faster web language.</p>
      <p>
         WebAssembly is a new type of code that can be run in modern 
         web browsers and provides new features and major gains in performance. 
         It is not primarily intended to be written by hand, rather it is designed 
         to be an effective compilation target for low-level source languages like 
         C, C++, Rust, etc.
